## Common Pitfalls

1. **Underestimating cultural change**: Technology is 30%, people are 70%
2. **Over-engineering initial solutions**: Start simple, evolve complexity
3. **Ignoring existing workflows**: Governance must fit how teams actually work
4. **Measuring wrong metrics**: Focus on enablement, not just compliance

These resources reflect years of consulting experience across industries and organization sizes. They're battle-tested through real transformations.
